# Windows Claude Code Spawn Issue - RESOLVED

## Status: ✅ FIXED

Both issues have been resolved. Claude Code now spawns correctly on Windows.

## Problem Summary

Claude Code was failing to spawn properly on Windows when Crystal runs it in a worktree directory different from where `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` is installed.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Error Code 193 (Fixed)

**Error:** `Failed to spawn Claude Code: Cannot create process, error code: 193`

**Cause:** Error code 193 on Windows means "not a valid Win32 application". This occurs when trying to execute a shell script (like npm bin stubs) directly via `node-pty` instead of through a shell or Node.js.

**Fix Applied:** Added detection for error code 193 in `AbstractCliManager.ts` to trigger the Node.js fallback.

**Location:** `main/src/services/panels/cli/AbstractCliManager.ts`

### Issue 2: Module Not Found (Fixed)

**Error:**
```
Error: Cannot find module 'C:\Users\khaza\allGitHubRepos\notetake\worktrees\@anthropic-ai\claude-code\cli.js'
```

**Cause:** The npm bin stub at `node_modules/.bin/claude` uses a relative path:
```bash
exec node "$basedir/../@anthropic-ai/claude-code/cli.js" "$@"
```

When the `cwd` is set to the worktree directory, the relative path resolves incorrectly.

## Solution Applied

### Fix 1: Proactive Windows Node.js Fallback

On Windows, we now proactively use the Node.js fallback instead of waiting for failures:

```typescript
// In spawnPtyProcess() at main/src/services/panels/cli/AbstractCliManager.ts
if (os.platform() === 'win32') {
  this.logger?.verbose(`Windows detected, using Node.js fallback proactively`);
  (global as typeof global & Record<string, boolean>)[needsNodeFallbackKey] = true;
}
```

This bypasses the problematic shell script execution entirely.

### Fix 2: Enhanced pnpm Path Resolution

The `findCliNodeScript()` function in `main/src/utils/nodeFinder.ts` was enhanced to properly handle pnpm's node_modules structure:

1. **Detects pnpm directory**: Checks for `node_modules/.pnpm` directory
2. **Known package mappings**: Has specific mappings for Claude Code and Codex packages
3. **Generic pnpm search**: Falls back to searching for any matching package
4. **Proper path construction**: Correctly builds paths like:
   ```
   node_modules/.pnpm/@anthropic-ai+claude-code@2.0.0/node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-code/cli.js
   ```

## Technical Details

### npm Bin Stub Structure (Windows)

The file at `crystal/node_modules/.bin/claude` is a shell script that:
1. Sets `NODE_PATH` with pnpm-specific paths
2. Executes: `node "$basedir/../@anthropic-ai/claude-code/cli.js" "$@"`

The `$basedir` is the directory containing the script, but when node-pty spawns with a different `cwd`, the relative path resolution breaks.

### Why the Proactive Approach?

The reactive fallback (catching error code 193) wasn't enough because:
- The spawn could "succeed" from node-pty's perspective
- But the process would exit immediately with code 1 (MODULE_NOT_FOUND)
- By the time we knew it failed, it was too late to retry

By proactively using Node.js on Windows, we avoid the shell script entirely and directly invoke the CLI script with the correct absolute path.

## Files Modified

1. `main/src/services/panels/cli/AbstractCliManager.ts` - Added:
   - Proactive Windows Node.js fallback detection
   - Error code 193 detection (reactive fallback)
2. `main/src/utils/nodeFinder.ts` - Enhanced `findCliNodeScript()` with:
   - pnpm structure detection
   - Known package mappings for Claude Code and Codex
   - Generic pnpm package search
   - Standard npm path resolution

## Debug Logs to Check

- `crystal-backend-debug.log` - Look for:
  - `Windows detected, using Node.js fallback proactively`
  - `Detected pnpm structure`
  - `Found pnpm CLI script at:`
  - `Using Node.js:`

## Test Commands

```bash
# Rebuild main process after changes
pnpm build:main

# Run in dev mode
pnpm electron-dev

# Check logs (PowerShell)
Select-String -Path crystal-backend-debug.log -Pattern "Claude|spawn|pnpm|NodeFinder"
```
